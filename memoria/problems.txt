Hi all,

I've followed the @krishnadev6's instructions and fixed the problem but i think it's will helpful for another one meeting this situation if we can detail the way to solve:

My enviroment:

    Host Machine on Vmware (XUbuntu 14.04 OS)
    Guest Machine on Virtualbox (in Vmware): Android x84 4.4 RC2

Ways to solve the problem
1, come to cuckoo/utils/hooks_generator
2. Run generate_hook_json.py with python generate_hook_json.py. It will create hook.json in the same folder.
3. Using adb to push hook.json into /data/local/tmp/hook.json on Guest Machine (You must be root) by running adb push hook.js /data/local/tmp
4. Finish
